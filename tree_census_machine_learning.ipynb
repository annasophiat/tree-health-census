We are classifying categorical variables. They are nominal, meaning that they do not have any intrinsic order to them, unlike ordinal variables. To measure our model's success, we are relying on a [classification report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html), which shows the main classification metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score.\n\nWe are using [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html), [KNeighborsClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html), [DecisionTreeClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html), and [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). We start by separating the target variable, y or tree health, from the feature variables, X. Next, we split X and y into training and test sets with 70% training and 30% testing. We train the models using training data and gauge their accuracy scores using a classification report.\n\nSince the classes are imbalanced, we use under sampling to minimize the size of majority samples so that each class may be represented as equally as possible. The technique we are using is edited nearest neighbors.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00001-f154d49c-e492-44fe-bc31-e68a3b24898e"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-2d92b0f4-8dec-48a7-a01d-b9d3964fbace"},"source":"import numpy as
